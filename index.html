            <p>Hello! My name is Ted Shishkovskiy and I am new to the world of coding and web-development. I decided to make this career change in order to reach my other life goals. Some of these goals include traveling, working from home and having exciting work I can do from the easy access of a Laptop/Computer. This journey excites me because it is a field that forces continueous learning and can be used to do so much more than just "Website Devolopment". I plan on sticking to this as a long-term career and this is just one small step to a much more engaging and challenging future.</p>
